# Qlik Sense Cache Initializer 

This is now the official home of Joe Bickley's CacheInitializer.

### Summary
This tool will "warm" the cache of a Qlik Sense server so that when using large apps, the users will experience shorter load times for their 'first' app opens and queries.  You can use it to load all apps, a single app, or you can use it to open the app and cycle through all the objects so that it will pre-calculate expressions to increase user performance. The cache initialzer also supports the ability to pass in selections.

### Download/Release
The project is now built in .NET Core, which means it can be run on any OS. That said, the download available currently under the releases section [here](https://github.com/eapowertools/CacheInitializer/releases), is a win64 executable (with all runtimes and dlls self contained). Since the executable contains all runtimes and dlls, you should be able to download and execute without any additional installs. You can rebuild the project yourself if you'd like to run it on a linux distribution or OS X.
